# 🚀 Heart Disease Prediction ML Project 🚀

Excited to share the results of my latest machine learning project on **Heart Disease Prediction**! 🧑‍⚕️💻  
Using classifiers like **K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, and Random Forest**, I developed a model that predicts heart disease with impressive accuracy. 🔍  

## 🔑 Key Highlights:
- **Random Forest Model**: 🎯 **100% accuracy** 🔥  
- **K-Nearest Neighbors**: 📈 **87.58% accuracy**  
- Focused on **model tuning** and exploring additional algorithms for future improvement.  

This project combines my passion for **data science** with **impactful healthcare solutions**. 💡
