## 🚀 Heart Disease Prediction ML Project 🚀
Excited to share the results of my latest machine learning project on Heart Disease Prediction! 🧑‍⚕️💻 Using classifiers like K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, and Random Forest, I was able to develop a model that predicts heart disease with impressive accuracy. 🔍
🔑 Key Highlights:
Random Forest Model: 100% accuracy 🔥
K-Nearest Neighbors: 87.58% accuracy
Focused on model tuning and exploring additional algorithms for future improvement.
This project combines my passion for data science with impactful healthcare solutions. 💡
